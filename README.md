Programming, problem-solving, and people fuel everything I do. I am a connector, a relationship builder, and a collaborator that leverages this strength to gain the buy-in of key stakeholders and bring teams into alignment through the project management lifecycle. My biggest strength is my ability to create a feeling of energy, excitement, and personal investment that inspires others to excel.

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I have been fascinated using technology to solve real world problems. Software development has allowed me to fuse creativity and logic -- taking a fresh approaches and being able to measure its success. I am a critical thinker and pride myself in my ability to anticipate long-term challenges and trends, understanding implications of decisions, and translating ideas and concepts into practical applications.
